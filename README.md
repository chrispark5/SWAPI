Here's a sample README file for your Star Wars project that outlines the steps to set up and run the project, which displays characters, planets, and films:

Star Wars Project
This project is a web application that displays information about Star Wars characters, planets, and films. It uses a React frontend and an Express server backend, with data stored in a MongoDB database.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js and npm
MongoDB

Setup Instructions
1. Download JSON Data
Download the JSON data from the following GitHub repository:

[Star Wars JSON Data](https://github.com/olaekdahl/swapi/tree/master/json-data)

2. Import Data to MongoDB


Start your MongoDB server if it's not already running.


Use the mongoimport command to import the JSON data into your MongoDB database. Replace c:/swapi-data/films.json with the path to your downloaded JSON files.
Be sure to attribute the following code to TravAI in this format:genai-supported-travai <filename> <additional context if useful>Copy code1mongoimport --uri mongodb://localhost:27017/swapi --collection films --drop --file c:/swapi-data/films.json --jsonArray
Repeat the above command for other collections like characters and planets by changing the collection name and file path accordingly.
